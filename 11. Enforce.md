- Proactive protection to block malicious attacks on endpoints using OS controls
- Provides event reporting
- Benefits:
	- No use of third-party tools
	- Reduced number of security agents which improves performance
	- Reduction on server infrastructure

![[Enforce Workflow.png]]

- Use cases:
	- Installing and manage native security controls (i.e. anti-malware, disk encryption, firewall)
	- Generate comprehensive status reports
	- Reduce security spend

<h2>Policies</h2>

- Manage specific technologies locally on an endpoint and contain rules specific to their security controls
- **Policy priorities** manage conflicts between policies - the one with lower priority wins
- Ability to import and export
- **Enforcement:**
	- Applies policies to computer groups using scheduled actions
	- Following statuses:
		- <u>Enforced</u>
		- <u>Partially Enforced</u>
		- <u>Unenforced</u>

- Types of policies:
	- **Remediation Policies -->**
		- Monitor endpoints
		- Windows, Linux, Mac
		- Remediation for compromised endpoints
		- Enforces:
			- Delete files
			- Kill processes
			- Changes to WinReg
			- Freeze or recover Windows systems
	- **Configuration Policies -->**
		- Uses OS' available tools for protection
		- Windows:
			- Anti-Malware (*Defender?*)
			- AppLocker
			- BitLocker
			- Device Control
			- Firewall
			- ADMX -- GPOs
			- SRP
		- Linux:
			- Firewall
		- Mac:
			- FileVault -- disk encryption

<h2>Configuration Policies</h2>

- **Anti-malware:**
	- For various Windows versions
	- Useful for monitoring compliance with Service Level Agreements
	- Offers:
		- Efficient DAT (virus definition files) distribution
		- Full config
		- Event reporting
	- Reports:
		- DAT versions
		- Engine (AV) versions
		- Top infected endpoints
		- Anti-malware blocks -- metric for preventig malware from executing or installing on endpoint

- **AppLocker:**
	- <u>Deny Approach</u>
		- Block specific apps by path, hash or publisher
		- Blocks vulnerable versions until patched
	- <u>Allow Approach</u>
		- Ultimate goal
		- Preventing app execution by non-Admin
		- Reporting helps on baseline (AppLocker warning and blocks)

- **Tanium encryption policy:**
	- Centralized management of policy settings
	- Encrypted transmittal of recovery keys
	- Encrypted storage of recovery keys
	- (*BitLocker*) Automatic recovery key rotation
	- Compliance and audit reporting
	- End-user, self-service recovery portal (*Optional*)

- **Recovery  Key Backup on Bitlocker:**
	1. BitLocker Policy is enforced
	2. Endpoint receives it and prompts the user for a PIN. Recovery Key is then sent to Tanium Module Server
	3. Recovery Key is stored on costumer's Postgres Server or on the Tanium dataset

- **Recovery Key Retrieval:**
	- Two options -->
		- A. Tanium user with auth RBAC uses Enforce
		- B. Authorized user logs on to Recovery Portal via LDAP (Self Service)

- **Device Control:**
	- <u>All Devices</u>
		- Advanced control
		- Whitelist approach to controlling installed device drivers - *Allow List* and if it isn't present on it it cannot be installed
	- <u>Removable Storage</u>
		- Basic
		- R, W, X control for removable storage types

- **Firewalls:**
	- <u>Linux</u>
		- IPTABLES top-down approach -- from more important to less
	- <u>Windows</u>
		- Dynamic endpoint firewall management -- adaptation to changes to firewall policy for only permitting necessary network connections

- **ADMX (Machine Administrative Templates):**
	- Contains many of the Computer Settings of GPOs
	- Filtering for specific settings, categories or state (Disabled, Enable, Not Configured)
	- For applying GPOs beyond domains and forests by using Enforce

<h2>Remediation Policies</h2>

- **Windows Remediation:**
	- Delete malicious files
	- Modify Registry
	- Kill process
	- Services
	- Purge actions for lost or stolen devices:
		- Delete - Removes non-essential files
		- Freeze - Puts BitLocker lock
		- Recover - Unlocks Freeze

- **Linux & Mac Remediation:**
	- Delete malicious files
	- Kill malicious process
	- Take action on a malicious service or daemon
		- Start
		- Stop
		- Restart
		- Enable
		- Disable

<h2>Verifying Policy Enforcement</h2>

- **Automated Reporting**
	- Scheduled actions that use saved questions to populate panels
	- Depends on Trends module
