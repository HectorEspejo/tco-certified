- Define sensitive data patterns
- Continuously monitor for matching IT artifacts
- Categorize, notify, alert or take direct action

- Used for:
	- Monitoring sensitive data across a number of endpoints
	- Search for new sensitive data in real time
	- Identify and leave data where it is
	- Maintain data compliance - GDPR, PCI, CCPA

<h2>Patterns</h2>

- Expressions that matches entities such as credit card numbers, email addresses

![[Reveal Pattern Example.png]]

- Two types of patterns
	- Self-made
	- Tanium-created
		- CCs
		- SSN
		- Email address

- Automatically updated every 24 hours
- Deploy may depend on Rule config or if it is immediately deployed

- **Custom Patterns**
	- <u>Keyword List</u> - easier to create and manage e.g. *ssn, social security number, credit card*
	- <u>Regex</u> - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions

<h2>Rules</h2>
- Combination of
	- Conditions prev defined
	- Labels to be applied

- Evaluated hourly
- When all conditions met, Reveal labels the file and reports it

``` 
// Example

Find SSN and Email Address in all PDF or Word Docs then apply label Personal

```

- **Rule sets**
	- Group of rules that are assigned to specific groups of endpoints
	- Contains at least one rule
	- Default ones cannot be edited - but can be deleted or duplicated

<h2>Quick Search</h2>

- For searching text strings in files without using rules or patterns
- Further investigate:
	- Finding matching filenames
	- Finding matching hashes
	- Finding similar files

<h2>Results & Rule Validations</h2>

- **Rules**
	- Viewed from specific Rule or Rule Set
	- Direct Connection needed to reveal list of files that match

- **Rule Validation**
	- Snippet marked
	- Set to *Confirm* or *Rejected*
	- Give name and description
