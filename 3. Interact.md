- Questions in plain English
- Gathering information
- **Dynamic:**
	1. Question is asked from the console
	2. Question is sent to Backward Leaders with server's private key
	3. String value is hashed so if it exists among answers the counter increments directly by one
	4. Permissions are verified - if there aren't the necessary permissions skips to the next device
	5. Process continues until one of these conditions occur
		- Answer portion of message is full
		- Question results have been passed through a certain number of computers
		- Question reaches the Forward Leader
- Use cases:
	- Determine OS' installed and running
	- Deploy actions
	- Create saved questions and dashboards

<h2>Asking Questions</h2>

- <b><u>Questions</u></b> - Collection of sensors used to retrieve information from endpoints
- Two key expressions:
	- <u>Data to be collected</u>
	- <u>Devices to answer the question</u>

- **Three methos for asking questions:**
	- <u>Ask a Question</u> - Enter the question directly. Dynamic and offers options while typing
	- <u>Question Builder</u> - Creating syntactically correct questions to send directly
	- <u>Saved Questions</u> - Questions that are saved for using on regular basis
- Syntax:
``` 
Get <Sensor> <Relational Operator> <Value> from all machines
```

```
//Example:

Get CPU ends with "2.40Ghz" from all machines
```

- Questions support:
	- <u>Strings:</u> *[not] contains*, *[not] starts with*, *[not] ends with*, *[not] matches*
	- <u>Numeric:</u> *=, !=, <, <=, >, >=*
- Filter syntax:
	- Repeating the syntax to get more granular results

```
Get <Sensor> from all machines with <Sensor> <Relational Operator> <Value>
```

Examples:

```
//1
Get Internet Explorer Version from all machines with Operating System contains "2008"

//2
Get Running Applications from all machhines with (Is Windows contains "true" and Installed Applications contains "Java")
```

- <u><b>Regular Expressions:</u></b>
	- <u>$substring() filters:</u> Match result string patterns
	- <u><i>In</i> operator:</u> A collection of matching sensor results - comma-separated boolean
	- <u>Nested filters:</u> Question with multiple filters (question-in-a-question)
	- <u>Column filtering:</u> Gathers info from another table column (like Join operator in SQL)

- <u><b>Advanced sensor options:</u></b>
	- <u><i>?type=</u></i> - Treats data as type. Supports following types followed by an operator:
		- Date / Time
		- File Size
		- Integer
		- IP Address
		- Numeric
		- Text
		- Time Duration
		- Version
		Example:
		```
		Get Free Memory?type=Numeric > 300 from all machines
		```
	- <u><i>sensor?maxAge=value</u></i> - Answers that have been sent in a period of time expressed in seconds
		Example:
		```
		Get Computer Name?maxAge=60 from all machines
		```
	- <u><i>sensor?ignoreCase=value</u></i> - If it's case sensitive or not
		- Value=0 --> Strict adherence to letter case
		- Value=1 --> Will show results regardless case

- **Question Builder:**
	- Syntactically correct questions
	- Sends directly to the server
	- Two key expressions to be specified:
		- Data to be collected
		- Devices to answer the question
	- Because of RBAC maybe all sensors are not listed

- **Counting questions:**
	- Results expressed in numbers
	- Example:
	```
	Get Operating System from all machines
	```

- **Grouping Questions:**
	- Non-counting
	- Best to not include sensors that return unique values e.g. "Computer Name"
	- Example:
	```
	Get Operating System and "Running Processes with Hash"[MD5] from all machines
	```

![[Grouping Questions Example.png]]

- **General Errors:**
	- <u><i>No Results</u></i> - Sensor returned no value
	- <u><i>Current Results Unavailable</u></i> - Client is busy
	- <u><i>Results Currently Unavailable</u></i> - Server does not have a string
	- <u><i>Too Many Results</u></i> - 1,000 rows from a single machine

- **Tanium Data Service:**
	- Allows you to see cached data from when the client was last online
	- Best for optimization is to collect data from low cardinality sensors

- **Drill Down:**
	- Retrieves additional information from selected endpoints
	- A filter added to sensors through asking additional questions
	- Typical use case is targeting a smaller group of endpoints for action

- **Merge:**
	- Similar to Drill Down but gathers more information from all results -- not just for the ones checked

<h2>Actions</h2>
- Deploying packages to make changes on endpoints
- Useful for install, remove or update applications

![[Action Process.png]]
- Two action types:
	- <u>On-Demand:</u> 
		- Executes once
		- Runs immediately or at future time
		- e.g. enforce desired-state
	- <u>Policy:</u>
		- Based on Saved Question
		- Fires if results are returned when the Saved Question is asked
		- E.g. persistent maintenance

- Target endpoints:
	- <u>Computer Groups:</u> Dynamic compound of endpoints that meets certain conditions e.g. True or False, Is Windows, Is Linux, etc. <-- **Preferred**
	- <u>Action Groups:</u> Compound of computer groups that are required for taking an action on them, whether they have common properties or not
