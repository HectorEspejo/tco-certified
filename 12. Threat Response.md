- Helps you take action on incidents
- Does the following:
	- Provides real-time threat detection and actionable alerts
	- Forensic and historical analysis with Index and Recorder
	- Contain threats by scoping and remediating endpoints and enforcing policies
- Unified defense-in-depth

<h2>Threat Response Components</h2>

- **Integration with Tanium Client:**
	- Monitoring and storing threat data
	- Intel for interpreting local actions and generate alers
	- Live connections from Threat Response
	- Can quarantine

- **Threat Response Components:**
	- <u>Incident Response Sensors</u>
	- <u>Index</u> - metadata catalog of all data on disk
	- <u>Stream</u> - send data in real-time to central repository e.g. Splunk
	- <u>Recorder</u> - continuous capture of forensic events
	- <u>Engine</u> - IOC scanning and Realtime Alerts

- **Index:**
	- Big virtual file cabinet
	- Keeps track of
		- Name or partial name
		- Permission
		- Hash
		- Magic Number
	- Creates events that can be used in other modules

- **Recorder:**
	- Continuous kernel-level monitoring on endpoint process activity
	- Works with Index for efficiently re-indexing and re-hashing files with changes

>**Knowledge check**
>Threat indexing allows for automatic and speedy lookups of threats using <u>file name, path, or hash</u>

- **Engine:**
	- Fueled with Intelligence:
		- IOCs
		- Signals - propietary intel of Tanium
		- Reputation - enhanced data with third-party services
	- Locate threats by
		- Scheduled background scanning
		- Quick scans for new intelligence
		- Real-time alerts via signals
	- Treating a threat by
		- Creating protection policies
		- Isolating
		- Removing the threat

<h2>Response Hygiene</h2>

- **Deployment Workflow:**
	- <u>Create and deploy a profile</u> - determines tools elegible:
		- Engine
		- Intel
		- Index
		- Recorder
	- <u>Install and use Threat Response Tools</u>

- **Maintening THR Environment:**
	- <u>Managing Intel</u>
		- Use all intel sources
		- Use labels
		- Test intel
	- <u>Alerts</u>
		- Adjust settings for controlling theme
		- Respond
	- <u>Health</u>
		- Client trends
		- Alert counts

- **Intel:**
	- Defines one or more conditions that might indicate malicious behavior
	- Types of intel:
		- Signals (real-time)
		- Quick scan
		- Background scan

- **Signals:**
	- Continuous, real-time evaluation:
		- Processes
		- Network / DNS
		- Registry
		- File events
	- Detects suspicious or interesting process behavior

- **Alerts:**
	- Result of a match on behavior when scanning
	- Actions that can be taken:
		- Live Connection
		- Deploy action
		- Evidence collection with Live Response
		- Quarantine
		- Snapshot of historical data
		- Download files
		- Deleting alert
		- Create Remediation Policy

<h2>Incident Response Workflow</h2>

- Handling of an attack
- Preconfigured sensors for this
- Preconfigured incident response packages

>**Knowledge Check**
>Tanium connect uses <u>Saved Questions</u> to pull key endpoint artifacts from the endpoints

<h2>Integrations</h2>

- **TR + Enforce** --> For remediation - apply policies
- **TR + Impact** --> Potential lateral movement that can occur
- **TR + Reputation** --> Reputation data from third-party sources
- **TR + Quarantine**
- **TR + Direct Connect**
