- Simplifies regulatory compliance by consolidating tools:
	- Monitors critical files from operating systems, applications and logs
	- Active investigation of alerts using other Tanium modules
	- Monitors common or new attack vectors

- Three sub-components:
	- **Monitors** - deploys tools and scan settings to endpoints for continuous event recording
	- **Watchlists** - set of files, directories and registry paths to be watched for changes
	- **Rules** - enables auto labeling and notification of events of concern

<h2>Watchlists</h2>

- Critical files and directories that are typically monitored for Windows and Linux
- Own watchlists and versions of them can be created
- Watches these operations:
	- **C** - create
	- **W** - write
	- **D** - delete
	- **R** - rename
	- **P** - permission

- **Inclusions & Exclusions** - refines files, directories and reg paths monitored
	- <u>Inclusion</u> - matches subdirectories, files or registry subkeys included
	- <u>Exclusion</u> -  opposite

<h2>Monitors & Events</h2>
- **Monitors:**
	- Defines scan settings for the endpoints
	- Can be deployed to multiple computer groups
	- **Best practice** - create as few monitors as possible

- **Events:**
	- Logs from monitors using the criteria of any associated watchlist
	- Categorization performed by attaching labels to observed events
	- Labels are stored on the endpoint DB

<h2>Rules</h2>

- Applied to monitors and enables auto labeling
	- Planned
	- Expected
	- Ignored
	- Suspicious
