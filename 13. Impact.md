>**Lateral movement**
>The technique where an attacker moves through a network after gaining initial access, searching for valuable data or systems and escalating privileges while remaining undetected


- How does it work:
	- Sensors collect Session IDs of computer, active ones and local admins
	- Tanium Module gets additional information from Active Directory
	- Information is stored on Tanium Module Server

- For identifying and visualizing risk on endpoints, users and groups
- Finding root cause of excessive admin rights
- Harden against lateral attack

<h2>Interpreting Results</h2>

- **Inbound vs Outbound**
	- <u>Inbound</u> -->
		- Number of users, groups and endpoints that have lateral movement path to the asset - ways an attacker could use to reach an asset
	- <u>Outbound</u> -->
		- Number of U, G and EP that can be reached from an specific user or asset

- **Direct vs Indirect Control** -->
	- <u>Direct Control</u>
		- How many systems can be accessed as local admin - user is admin on system
	- <u>Indirect Control</u>
		- How many systems can be accessed via group membership - had admin perms from groups

- **Member of**
	- <u>Direct Members</u>
		- Assets directly assigned to a group
	- <u>Indirect Members</u>
		- Assets assigned through nested groups - group is member of another group

- **Shortest Path**
	- Shortest path to reach an asset:
		- Use credentials stored on session
		- Member of group
		- Local Admins group

>**Knowledge Check**
>Which account or group would be analyzed by Impact?
>	--> *Both Domain and Local Admin*

<h2>Identifying Critical Assignments</h2>

- **Users:**
	- Examine those with high impact counts - inbound (potential vulnerability on an attack) & outbound (potential reach to that user)
	- Common groups

- **Groups:**
	- Sorting by Direct Members
	- Sorting by Indirect

- **Individual Components:**
	- Harden endpoints with highest potential for lateral movement
	- Inbound for specific assets

>**Knowledge Check**
>Which impact label will  display the most direct way to reach an asset?
>	--> *Shortest Path*

<h2>Addressing Lateral Movement</h2>

- **Integrations:**
	- Threat Response includes on the alerts the Outbound Impact
	- Prioritize based on this
	- Isolate and remediate

- **Remediation Paths:**
	- Proactively analyze Inbound and Outbound
	- Shortest Path
	- Least-privilege model
	- Check Impact after remediation
	- Scope potential lateral movement
