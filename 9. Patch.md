- Patching in Tanium relies on the speed and scale of the platform making it more simple
- Ability for creating Patch Lists for QA testing and production patching
- Compliance
- Address zero-day vulns
- Support for Windows, Linux and MacOS - M1 is unsupported

<h2>Scan configurations</h2>

- Before a scan configuration details for Windows and Linux must be set and then targeted computer groups specified
- **Priorities** can be useful for determining which configuration must take place on an endpoints targeted by multiple scans
- There are some optional configs:
	- <u>Windows</u>
		- **Offline CAB file** --> Security patches
		- **Online Windows Update**
		- **Tanium Scan** --> Synced with Microsoft Update catalog
		- **Windows Server Update Services**
	- <u>Linux</u>
		- **Repository scan (local / custom or cloud based**
		- **Tanium scan** --> Pulls from specified repo

<h2>Patches</h2>

- **Patch lists:**
	- Rule-based patch deployment
	- After OS selection rules selects patches and add them - can be done manually too
	- It is optional to create them but strongly recommended for best practices

<h2>Block Lists</h2>

- Blocks patches via rules
- Targets computer groups
- Achieves granularity in terms of creation and maintenance of fewer patch lists

<h2>Deployments</h2>

- **Maintenance Windows:**
	- Determines when patches should be installed
	- Controls reboots
	- Specific to patch lists and block lists
- **Deployments:**
	- For installing or uninstalling patches
	- Important options:
		- <u>Download Immediately</u>
		- <u>Distribute Over Time</u> - better for virtual hosts
		- <u>Override Maintenance Windows / Block Lists</u> - useful for patches for zero-day vulns
		- <u>Notify User</u> - oriented to workstations and laptops
- **Deployment Templates:**
	- For enforcing specific settings repeatedly and automatically
	- Common use cases:
		- Preserving notification messaging and behavior
		- Emergency patching
		- Server patching - no notification
- **Target deployment:**
	- Best to run some test deployments and tune the definition - adding patches with issues to block lists for example
	- Possible targets:
		- <u>By Computer Groups or Targeting Question</u>
		- <u>By Computer Names</u>

>**Knowledge Check**

- **Steps to perform when creating patch lists:**
	1. Specify platform OS
	2. List of available patches
	3. Select them automatically (rules) or manually
