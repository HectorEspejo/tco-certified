- Collects asset data on an ongoing basis and it's viewable in the Tanium Console - **Inventory**
- Reports can be export for many situations such as a configuration management DB
- Simplifies the inventory process by collecting data on a frequent schedule from online and offline devices
- Can report software information too

>**Why Asset and not just Interact?**
>Interact shows online endpoints in real time. Asset on the other hand provides the most up-to-date data - and reports what the enterprise has, not just what is or isn't online. Also throws info of vulnerable software


<h2>Reports</h2>

- Displays stored asset data:
	- Installed software
	- VMs
	- Primary user per machine --> analyzes last 30 days logon events to figure it out
	- Hardware associated with specific department users
- Purging of all data is enabled by default and set to 180 days but can be customize (>7 days min.)

- **Entities and attributes**: Determines what data is populated in Asset (e.g. columns included in reports)
	- Attributes can come from Tanium or a configured source e.g. SQL server
	- RBAC can be applied

- **Views:**
	- For exporting large volumes of data to external destinations via Connect e.g. ServiceNow
	- Grouping and filtering are possible

<h2>Sources and destinations</h2>

- **Sources** are information pulled from external DBs and saved questions

>**Best Practice**
>Setting a primary key field for unique identification i.e. serial number, computer name

- **Destinations** --> Information delivered to third-parties (maybe ServiceNow or Flexera)
	- Formats:
		- File output (JSO, CSV, TSV, HTML)
		- SQL database
		- SMTP
		- Syslog

- **ServiceNow configuration:**
	- Provides network device inventory for datacenter components that cannot run a Tanium CLient
	- Enables an easier collection of asset data
	- For exporting:
		- Recent version of ServiceNow
		- Elevated account there for initial configuration and sync - but better to give necessary permissions to the account once finished this
	- ServiceNow URL
	- Tanium as a data source in SN

- **Flexera configuration:**
	- Access to Connect
	- Schedule actions with a Tanium Admin account
	- SQL server for staging
	- Windows or mixed mode authentication


<h2>Software Inventory & Usage</h2>

- **All Products:**
	- Product summaries and relevant data points
	- Useful for license revoking or remove unapproved software
- **All Vendors:**
	- List products associated to vendors and track versions, endpoints and usage
	- Reporting of product can be enabled / disabled from here
