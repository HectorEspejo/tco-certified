- Uses architecture to find devices on the network - managed or unmanaged
- Two main categories:
	1. <u>Asset discovery</u> --> 
		- Categorize interfaces
		- Find endpoints to deploy Tanium
		- Find endpoints with client issues
	2. <u>Security focus</u> -->
		- Find rogue interfaces / devices uncontrolled by NetAdmin
		- Find endpoints with disabled clients
		- Find remote interfaces with vulnerabilities using *Comply*

- **Active Scanning:**
	- All endpoints are scanning
	- Managed endpoints are issued a question and respond with their unmanaged interfaces

<h2>Scan Profiles</h2>

- **Centralized** --> 
	- Scan from the Tanium Module Server
	- For environments with no Tanium Clients
- **Distributed** --> 
	- Scanning from Tanium Clients with Discover tools installed
	- Ping / Nmap
- **Satellite Scans** -->
	- For finding interfaces in unmanaged subnets

<h2>Discovery Methods</h2>

<table border="1"> <tr> <th>Level 1 Passive</th> <th>Level 2 Active</th> <th>Level 3 Active</th> <th>Level 4 Active</th> </tr> <tr> <td> <strong>Pros</strong> <ul> <li>Generates no network scanning traffic</li> </ul> <strong>Cons</strong> <ul> <li>Returns limited data</li> <li>Can return stale results</li> </ul> </td> <td> <strong>Pros</strong> <ul> <li>Investigates every IP space within range</li> </ul> <strong>Cons</strong> <ul> <li>Generates ICMP traffic</li> <li>Bad actors can "hide" from these scans</li> </ul> </td> <td> <strong>Pros</strong> <ul> <li>More consistent data than using ping</li> </ul> <strong>Cons</strong> <ul> <li>Generates network traffic that can trigger intrusion detection alerts</li> </ul> </td> <td> <strong>Pros</strong> <ul> <li>More consistent data than using ping</li> <li>Provides Operating System detection and Port Scan results</li> </ul> <strong>Cons</strong> <ul> <li>Generates network traffic that can trigger intrusion detection alerts</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>


<h2>Scan Inclusions and Exclusions</h2>

- **Scan Inclusions** --> 
	- Scans an specific network and computer group
- **Scan Exclusions** --> 
	- Broader scans by excluding specific networks

- Additional parameters:
	- Inc and Exc lists can be modified
	- **Isolated Systems** --> Tanium-managed endpoints that are not peering with other endpoints of the same nature
	- Isolated Systems / Subnets depends on Tanium Isolated Subnets

<h2>Organizing Interfaces</h2>

- **Labels:**
	- Group of interfaces with common attributes
	- Additional attributes -->
		- <u>Ignore</u> 
		- <u>Unmanageable</u> - Can't run the client
		- <u>Send notification</u>
		- <u>Purge from Discover database</u>
	- **Lost Interface:**
		- Criteria -->
			- Last managed older than 24 hours
			- Last Discovered in the last 4 hours

- **Locations:**
	- Categorize interfaces based on IP addresses into geographic and physical locations
	- Can be set RBAC to hide some locations
	- Can be imported manually via CSV file

<h2>Tanium Client Management</h2>

- Shared service imported into the Tanium server
- Allows deployment of Tanium Client to any place on the network
- <u>Workflow:</u>
	- Required setup - service account and Tanium Public Key
	- Configure clients
	- Configure credentials
	- Deploy clients


> Note:
	- Ports have to be open for comms via SMB or SSH from TMS to endpoint
	-Admin / sudo permissions required for installing
