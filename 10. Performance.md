- Solves:
	- **Lack of visibility:**
		- Sometimes problems are reported only by users
		- Difficult to measure effects of changes (soft or hard) on performance
	- **Current troubleshooting methods are insufficient:**
		- Manual troubleshooting processes and error-prone techniques (e.g. killing processes)
	- **Existing solutions are costly**

- Benefits:
	- Increase IT efficiency - quickly solving issues
	- Better decision-making
	- UX improvement

- Features:
	- Critical metrics on resource consumption and application health
	- Problem solving by analyzing common points
	- Investigation with historic data from each endpoint

<h2>Profiles</h2>

- Used to configure what it has to be monitored (NEGATIVE CONDITIONS) on computer groups
- Purposes:
	- Configuration of event rules
	- Configuration of endpoint settings
- Retention:
	- By size
	- By days

- **Rules:**
	- Events are joined with Booleans:
		- <u>AND</u> --> Event is reported if all conditions are true
		- <u>OR</u> --> Event is reported if any of the conditions are true
	- Measures the following categories:

<h2>Events</h2>

- For analyzing the most common types of problems
- Visualizes worst endpoints at scale
- Can filter by computer groups and time for better investigation
- Pivoting to Interact:
	- Drilldown to investigate
	- Take action - i.e. kill process, uninstall MSI, stop service, etc.

- **Categories:**
	- Categorizes events
	- Easier to find commonalities
	- Visualize resource-intensive processes

- **Endpoint Details:**
	- Filter by more specific details of endpoints
	- Direct Connect to endpoint of interest

<h2>Direct Connect</h2>

- **Live task manager:**
	- Updates every 5 seconds
	- Ability to terminate processes:
		- Only for roles -->
			- Performance Admin
			- Performance Operator
			- Performance Kill Process

- **Endpoint info:**
	- Details:
		- CPU
		- Memory
		- Disk Space
		- Logged In Users
	- Moving through time:
		- Pan
		- Zoom
		- Custom scope

- **Events table:**
	- <u>Recent Events</u>
	- <u>Scope change</u>
	- <u>Top Processes</u> - by avg consumption
	- <u>Details</u>
