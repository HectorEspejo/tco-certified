- **Assessments**
	- Scans endpoints continuously
	- Targets specific config checks, check values and vulnerabilities (*Standards*)

- Assesses systems for compliance with policies
	- Endpoint configuration
	- Vulnerability scanning
	- Ad-hoc scanning for visibility of enterprise security issues
	- Identification of specific security and policy issues on machines
	- Metrics and reporting for data export to SIEMs, DBs, etc.

<h2>Assessments</h2>

- Supported scanning engines:
	- CIS-CAT Pro
	- Tanium Scanning Engine
	- SCAP Compliance Checker

- Assessment types:
	- **Compliance:**
		- Security compliance check on machines on schedule
	- **Vulnerability:**
		- OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language) checks
	- **Remote vulnerability (with Tanium Discover)**
		- Find vulnerabilities on unmanaged endpoints

- Scan types:
	- **Client-based** - scans endpoints with Client installed
	- **Remote Authenticated** - info from endpoints that don't support Client

>**Knowledge Check**
>Comply supports community-sourced and commercial scanning engines such as *SCC, JovalCM and CIS-CAT*

<h2>Standards</h2>

- Two types:
	- **Compliance** - 3rd party content from common providers in OVAL Benchmarks
		- e.g. CIS, DISA, OpenSCAP, etc.
	- **Vulnerability** - the Tanium Vulnerability Library (TVL)
		- Vulnerabilities per os
		- Search for specific CVEs
		- Automated updates

>**Knowledge Check**
>Tanium Comply provides the Tanium Vulnerability Libraries, which are *OVAL* vulnerability definitions

<h2>Reports</h2>

- Relevant benchmark findings of targeted endpoints
- Can be exported into CSV or HTML
- Three types of reports:
	- Compliance - remediation info and additional details
	- Vulnerability - hyperlinks to NVD, MITRE and vuln bulletins from some vendors
	- Remote Vulnerability - vuln reports from unmanaged endpoints

<h2>Findings</h2>

- Result of a check or a rule
- PASS, FAIL, N/A
- Filters can be used to analyze and investigate data
- It's possible to export them to:
	- Comply
	- Interact
	- Connect
