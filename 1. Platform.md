- **Linear Chain Topology:**
	- Eliminates multiple primary management servers
	- No relay servers
	- Directed, secured, client-to-client communication
	- Clients share load on data collection - less stress / traffic

- **On startup**:
	- Neighborhood List: 10 computers to the left - 10 computers to the right
	- Each client connects via TCP with 3 computers to left and 3 to right
	- **Backward Leader:**
		- Computer with no clients to its left
		- Establishes persistent TCP connection with Tanium server
		- Sends messages / queues from the Tanium server
	- **Forward Leader**:
		- Computer with no clients on its right
		- Sends response from all other computers to Tanium server

<h2>Deployment On-prem</h2>

- Necessary:
	- <u>Tanium application server</u> + <u>Tanium Module Server pair</u>
	- <u>Microsoft SQL Server or Postgres DBMS</u>
	- <u>Tanium Client installed on each server</u>

- Optional:
	- <u>Tanium Zone Server</u>
		- For managing systems across different security zones
		- Extra security layer

<h2>Tanium Cloud</h2>

- No customer infraestructure
- No software installation
- Configured and maintained automatically
- Single tenant
- Connect through web browser
- Focused on just managing endpoints

<h2>Tanium Content</h2>

- **Sensors:**
	- Information gathered on an endpoint and returned to the TS
	- Defined with one or more OS-specific scripts
- **Saved Questions**:
	- Questions are made of one or more sensors
	- Saved questions can be used to target endpoints and gather info
- **Packages**:
	- Set of instructions for altering an endpoint's behavior
	- Useful when actions must be taken on endpoints

<h2>Sensors</h2>

- Building blocks of questions
- Similar structure to SQL

``` 
// Example 1

Get <sensor> from all machines

// Example 2

Select <column> from <table>
```

- Hundreds of out-of-the-box sensors for:
	- Asset discovery
	- Applications
	- Operating systems
	- Compliance
	- Vulnerability identification

- A sensor is a script that runs on the system and retrieves info
- Runs with Administrator / root permissions
- RBAC - Limit who can use different sensors

<h2>Saved Questions</h2>

- Useful on day-to-day operations
- Possibility of adding more saved questions

<h2>Packages</h2>

- Set of command-line instructions for a Tanium client - with maybe setting, scripts and other files required
- Made of *shards* - pieces of 64KBs
- Rapid file distribution with minimal impact to WAN connections
